These are my home directory dot files.

## Installation

See https://github.com/andsens/homeshick?source=cc#installation
dotdaven is a repository that works with the homeshick setup. The prompt is based on a couple themes from bash-it.

Quick install:

```
git clone git://github.com/andsens/homeshick.git $HOME/.homesick/repos/homeshick
printf '\nalias homeshick="$HOME/.homesick/repos/homeshick/home/.homeshick"' >> $HOME/.bashrc
source .bashrc
homeshick clone git://github.com/davenuman/dotdaven.git
