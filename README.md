These are my home directory dot files.

Installation
============

See https://github.com/andsens/homeshick?source=cc#installation
dotdaven is a repository that works with the homeshick setup. The prompt is based on a couple themes from bash-it.

After installing, create a symlink for the bash include files:
ln -s ~/.homesick/repos/dotdaven/bash_inc ~/.bash_inc
